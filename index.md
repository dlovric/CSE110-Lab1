Hello, my name is Dominik Lovric and I am currently a 4th year Computer engineering student here at UCSD. I'm not the strongest programmer, but I have been programming since high school when I completed AP Computer Science. I first learned Java, and once I was in community college I was taught C++ and here we are! I hope to learn a lot more in this class and to refine more of my programming skills.
